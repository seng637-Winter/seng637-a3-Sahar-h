# 1. Introduction

# 2. Manual data-flow coverage calculations for X and Y methods

# 3. A detailed description of the testing strategy for the new unit test

# 4. A high level description of five selected test cases you have designed using coverage information, and how they have increased code coverage

# 5. A detailed report of the coverage achieved of each class and method (a screen shot from the code cover results in green and red color would suffice)

# 6. Pros and Cons of coverage tools used and Metrics you report

# 7. A comparison on the advantages and disadvantages of requirements-based test generation and coverage-based test generation

# 8. A discussion on how the team work/effort was divided and managed

# 9. Any difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned from performing the lab

# 10. Comments/feedback on the lab itself
